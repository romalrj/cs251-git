Two  are searching for their long lost companion.

The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college.
 It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader
 of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads
 his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel
 education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success;
 questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming;
 and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make
 a difference.
=======
Two friends are searching for their long lost companion.They revisit their college days 
and recall the memories of their friend who inspired them to think differently, 
even as the rest of the world called them "idiots".
