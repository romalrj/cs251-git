\textbf{Title: 3 Idiots}
\textbf{Director: Rajkumar Hirani}
\textbf{Screenplay: Rajkumar Hirani, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Abhijat Joshi}
The high point of the film is the fact that director Rajkumar Hirani says so much, and more, without losing his sense of humour and the sheer lightness of being. The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's chamatkar/balatkar speech, the threesome's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself.

Two friends are searching for their long lost companion.They revisit their college days 
and recall the memories of their friend who inspired them to think differently, 
even as the rest of the world called them "idiots".
